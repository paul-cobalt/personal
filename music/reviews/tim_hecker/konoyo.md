I already wrote a review for this one, so copy-pasting here:

Tim Hecker has been making ambient music since 2001. Perhaps his most famous album is Ravedeath, 1972, which you should listen to immediately if it passed you by in 2011. Since Ravedeath, his music has gradually become more dissonant. See Love Streams, his lovely 2016 album, which had long passages of rhythmic chaos and harmonic clash.

In Konoyo, Tim continues his exploration of dissonance, but in a different context. Whereas Love Streams burst at the seams with energy, Konoyo is muted and introspective. The dissonance consists of two horns wailing at each other, or of tremolo on the violin which is undercut by a strange, underworld tapping.

This is a methodical album, with melodies that unfold imperceptibly over time; but I didnâ€™t find it difficult or exhausting to listen to. Tim Hecker is a master at charging an ambient buzz of sound with emotion, and the album, while heavy, never feels impersonal. It put me in mind of an Arctic explorer, trekking over a landscape which is often foreboding, but never fails to be beautiful.
