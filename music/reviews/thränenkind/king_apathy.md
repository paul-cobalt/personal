Post-rock is such a beautiful genre, when it isn't boring. I remember when I discovered Explosions in the Sky
in high school, and *The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place*. It was smooth, ethereal music--a hint that,
later in life, I would fall in love with the ambient genre.

*King Apathy* is not post-rock. It's death metal. But it has hints of what make post-rock great, that elevate
it to the next tier of quality. The first half of "Vanishing Youth," the most introspective track,
could be taken from an Explosions in the Sky album. (A good one.) The second half of "Ghosts" has a beautiful,
expressive guitar, which is more memorable than the voice. Almost every track has an interlude
with a post-rock flavor.

What do all these post-rock interludes contribute? Balance. The vocals on this album are harsh. They aren't my
favorite, and I've heard that other people don't like them much either. They're a good match for
the mournful, blunt lyrics: "We breath with cancer in our lungs / We'll die with plastic in our mouths." But an
hour of that kind of in-your-face despair would be exhausting.

The beautiful guitars, and the deliberate pacing, suggest that this album was formed in a place of balance.
The lyrics and the vocalist might sound distressed and exhausted and, yes, even a little ugly. But the
ugliness is made powerful precisely because of the contrast that it makes with the
centered guitars and drums.

*King Apathy* is also a remarkably consistent album. All the tracks are winners. The production quality is superb.
It's a fairly easy choice, honestly, for top honors, even if the vocals aren't my favorite.
