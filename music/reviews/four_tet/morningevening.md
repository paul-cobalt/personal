After finding a clip of a woman singing in Hindi on the Internet, Four Tet loops it about ten thousand times on top of some tasteful drumming, synth pulses, hard-hitting dance beats, spacey twinkles. When that becomes passe, he loops it on top of itself. All this is superbly executed. How Four Tet conceived of this, I have no idea, particularly in light of the fact that all his previous albums have been shit. Itâ€™s like if Justin Beiber suddenly composed the Moonlight Sonata.

Experimental electronic/psych electronic. Morning Side is better but Evening Side has its moments too. Tasteful, delicate, hopeful. A little crystal figurine in a genre accustomed to producing gaudy plastic.
