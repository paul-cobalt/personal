Some black metal albums have crunchy hooks and tight songs. *The Inveterate Fire* feels more like
jazz. The tracks are long and unfold over several sequential melodies or themes.

There are advantages to this style. It can feel organic, and I find that albums like this hold up
well to repeated listens. But there is one unfortunate side effect, which is that individual tracks aren't so memorable. A track feels like a meander through a park, rather than a blast of genius. I remember bits of
each of the tracks, but the tracks as a whole are hard to visualize.

Unsurprisingly, *The Inveterate Fire* took a while to grow on me. At first, it felt like a formless mess. But
there are moments of inspiration that, even on first listen, surprised me. I love everything from
6:20 to 8:30 on "Kindled," or the quiet opening to "Beckoning Sun." The end of
"Beckoning Sun" reminds me of Deafheaven--the part of Deafheaven I like. It nails the weird mix of
shoegaze and black metal.

This album is too formless and meandering to get the highest possible rating from me, but I think
it conjured a compelling atmosphere, and had lots of moments that captured my attention.
