A man is sent into space in a tiny white pod. He stares out the window at the stars passing by, his eyes wide open.
“Holy shit,” he says to himself. Later, he decides to make an album about the experience.

Indie electronic/ambient. Earnest layers of synth. Try “Arpeggiare” or “Aequus” or “Caduceus.” One warning which
needs to be offered is that Steve’s songs often have a minute or more or intro before anything actually happens.
Who knows why.
