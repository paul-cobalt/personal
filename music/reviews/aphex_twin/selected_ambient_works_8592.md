No, this is not the EP that Aphex Twin that released this year, although that was pretty good too. This is Aphex Twin’s first album, from 1992. I can’t count how many times I listened to this album this year.

It’s not as frenetic as Aphex Twin’s modern music: instead, it takes its time, ambling through breathtaking musical landscapes. The landscape often have a fog hanging over them--listen to the first track, “Xtal,” if you want an example of what I’m talking about--but they manage to remain crisp and refreshing. Although the album title says that this is ambient music, this is really soft dance music. It has a surprising amount of verve.

Some of the tracks are an absolute joy to listen to. I’m thinking of “Ptolemy,” which has Egyptian flair and which pulls off the delicate trick of being funny and cool at the same time. Or “We Are the Music Makers,” with its playful bass and snarky vocal sample. Aphex Twin’s music has always had a good sense of humor, but I don’t think that I actually laughed out loud listening to one of his albums until this one.
