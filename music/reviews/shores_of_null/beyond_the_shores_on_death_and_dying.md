When I saw that this album was one long track, most of the hope that I had for it being excellent died. One-track albums are, almost universally, sprawling self-indulgent messes.

But somehow, this thing actually works? I like that it isn’t in a rush to get where it’s going. Lyrics are almost always repeated, and the pace is languid. That makes it sound self-indulgent, but on a moment-to-moment basis, the album actually feels polished and compact. Thirty-minutes is long for a track, but short for an album. There isn’t a lot of slack here.

The guitars have a clean, sharp sound that I really like. There are also like five vocalists, so whenever I get tired of one, another is swapped in. The doom vocals are a matter of taste, of course, but they never linger for that long...they just add some interesting flavor. I’m really impressed that this album didn’t bore me.

Also, I would never call it catchy, but there are parts of this album that I have sung along with. “Life is at war with us” is a great refrain.

If you like slow, methodical music, and you can tolerate doom vocals, then this album is a treat.
