This album was released in 2014, but it only just arrived at KZSU, so I’m counting it as 2016. Icelandic minimalist techno. Wikipedia classifies it as experimental, but I think that’s a stretch. It’s probably possible to dance to this, if you wanted to.

The best tracks on this album have sound effects which inspire awe. “Burnt” opens with shimmering layers of synth which remind me of an Arctic aurora, while the final two minutes of “Looped” sound like driving around on a cold night, experiencing a moment of transcendence. The reason why everything works so well is the attention to detail. Organic instruments such as strings and piano are tastefully mixed in. New beats introduce themselves shyly before increasing in volume to become cornerstones. A great example of this happens at 2:30 in “Looped.” The new beat is introduced as though it were just an accent. Two minutes later, it powers the emotional climax of the song.

Best songs: “Looped,” “Burnt”
