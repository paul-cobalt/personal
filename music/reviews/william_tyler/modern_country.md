The only folk album in my top ten this year. Tyler considers himself a folk/country guitarist, but I think the reason why I liked this album so much is that it functions as something ambient.

This album is another great example of expressive guitar. Tyler’s guitar is the hero and de facto vocalist on this album. It has a classic rock, 1970’s kind of sound, with careful use of reverb. Unlike in Rehumanizer (which has epic synths) or Hypatia (which has a vocalist), the guitar is the only thing to pay attention to here. It’s not just the protagonist of the album’s story; the guitar is telling the story.

If this sounds boring, I have to admit that the tension is strung low. But god, this is beautiful. “Highway Anxiety” is one of the most lovely tracks that I heard this year. One riff is repeated all the way through. It rises in intensity--not surprising, if you listen to any music at all. What’s breathtaking is how, after it reaches a climax, Tyler takes the time to set the melody on the floor again. The drums fall away, dreamy synth comes in, and the guitar begins to repeat fragments of the riff--then smaller fragments--until nothing is left.

Tyler also makes surpassingly good use of light synth and what I might call “noise.” “Noise” is a dangerous word...most “noise” albums are just ugly. Tyler understands that even noise should be beautiful. “The Great Unwind” becomes drenched in static from 1:00 to 3:00. This part of the album is unsettling, which is the effect of noise, but it’s absolutely sublime.

Speaking of “The Great Unwind,” this is my other favorite track. In the first half, a simple riff is drowned and ultimately swallowed by noise. For thirty seconds, we just hear birds singing. Then a new melody fades in, different from the old one. The tone is confident, revitalized. It feels like a resurrection.

Best tracks: “Highway Anxiety,” “The Great Unwind”
