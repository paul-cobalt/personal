Really nice EP from the Vermont artist who made her reputation layering recordings of herself playing cello on top of each other. This EP has some fairly long intervals in which there is no cello at all, but the most beautiful and dramatic moments are still captured by the instrument which she knows best.

“Forte” is the track which people seem to be listening to the most, but I actually think the standout track is “Possible,” which has a wonderful sense of drama and reminds me of wintertime.
