It's a bit boring at times and didn't hold my interest all the way through, but I always have a soft soft for
medieval finger picking mixed with crystal clear rock guitars. The production value on this thing is really good.
The simple medieval transition tracks are perhaps my favorite ...they have a lovely, lilting grace. The tracks
themselves don't have much variety or dramatic tension, which is why I can't give this album a stronger
recommendation, but I am still glad that I found it.
