Let’s get it out of the way--yes, the vocalist is not great. I would love it if Will Wiesenfeld sounded like Caribou. But he doesn’t, so we’re just going to have to deal with it. At least he doesn’t sing on every track.

If you don’t mind the voice, this is a remarkably friendly and engaging electronic album. The first two tracks, “Knapsack” and “Swiss Bicycle,” are whimsical gems. If you don’t mind the cuteness, you should find them delightful. The final track, “Maglev,” is a tour de force: not cute at all, instead a perilously catchy dance number, with swooning violins and a crisp beat.
