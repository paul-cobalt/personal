I've wondered in the last couple years...do I actually like prog music at all?
I've enjoyed, but not adored, several prog albums: [*Veil of Imagination*]
(https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/101) and, very recently, [*The Long Dream*]
(https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/114). Prog music is often interesting,
often has a great flow, but usually fails to grab my heart and not let it go.

*Virus* ripped those doubts into a thousand pieces and scattered them to the winds.
The first half of this album is the strongest thirty minutes of music that I have
heard this year. The rhythms are fascinating and have the emotional pull of a
dance track. (It would be hard to dance to this though.) The pure male voice is
remarkably compelling, and even the lyrics are catchy. I actually found myself
singing along. Many of the tracks have a heartbreaking central moment that is based
around a few words. In "Canary Yellow," for example: "You tried to save the world /
When it's you that needs help."

Metal music has a frustrating tendency to be bloated and over the top. Progressive
metal, especially so. If you listen to *Veil of Imagination*, you will hear a full
orchestra...*The Long Dream* does some audio manipulation of vocals that I think
was mistaken. Except at a couple of moments in the second half of the album, *Virus*
is stunningly tight and well-composed. There are no extraneous elements, and no
distracting nonsense in the background. I think that this is one reason why the
vocals land so well. When the vocalist sings "you tried to save the world / when
it's you that needs help," I can remember that I am listening to a human singing into a
microphone, not an alien keening in a bizarre sonic landscape.

The second half of the album is more experimental and not quite as tight. It's also
extremely technical, to a level that I found distracting. Even
here, though, there are moments to celebrate. I can remember exactly how the vocalist
sings "careful what you wish for Marigold."

Absolutely terrific stuff.
