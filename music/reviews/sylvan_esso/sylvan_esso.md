Think of the hippest coffeeshop you know. Sylvan Esso is playing there right now. This album is the most brightly polished little machine in the shop.

Indie electronic/pop. Sparse instrumentations, dubstep-inspired beats. The hero of this album is the producer. Try “Coffee” or “Dress” or “H.S.K.T” or “Hey Mami.”
