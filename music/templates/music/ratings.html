<h1>Note on ratings</h1>
<p>
    I rate music the same way that the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide">Michelin people rank food</a>.
    One star means that I liked it, two stars means I thought it was great, and three stars means that I can't stop
    listening to it.
</p>
<p>If I don't like it, it isn't on this website.</p>
